Day 4: No Longer Integer Gradient Lines [Feb 14, 2025]

Removed the real number bug finally. The idea of TOLERANCE in the colors is working well. Still not connecting the lines however. Will need a script to do that at some stage.

Day 3: Still Integer Gradient Lines [Feb 12, 2025]

Need to fix the integer gradient lines. Still evident.

Day 2: Real Number Gradients [Feb 11, 2025]

Using real number lines not integer lines. Need to write a line reducing algorithm.

Day 1: Simplification and Reduction [Feb 9, 2025]

Reduced the code down to a single file. Removed the sleep and allowed the code to run easily. May move back to larger file as this one is rendered quickly down to blocks of color.

Now calculate lines of one of the top sixteen colors over the image. There needs to be a recreation program that takes this file and recreates the image. To be continued...
